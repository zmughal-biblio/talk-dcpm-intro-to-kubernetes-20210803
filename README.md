# Introduction to Kubernetes Workshop

## Abstract

> The talk/workshop will cover the Kubernetes container orchestration tool and
> how to use it to configure a cluster. First we'll cover the core
> concepts/processes of what makes up a Kubernetes cluster. Then we'll
> work step-by-step on how to test out Kubernetes configurations locally
> using `minikube`. Finally, we'll discuss specific applications/patterns
> for using Kubernetes and other alternatives for orchestration. Basic
> knowledge of Docker / containers is assumed.
